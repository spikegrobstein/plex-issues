Please adhere to the following flow:

1. title the issue with the name of the content
2. tag with the type of media (`tv` or `movie`)
3. tag with the type of issue (eg: `mislabeled`)
4. add a brief description of the issue in the body

(you may not have access to add labels, in that case, just describe the issue in the body of the issue)
